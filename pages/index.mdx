Welcome to the official documentation for **Parametriks**. Parametriks is a B2B startup dedicated to transforming the insurance industry by helping insurers lower their insurance payouts through advanced risk mitigation and claims reduction strategies. We leverage predictive algorithms and cutting-edge IoT technology to achieve these outcomes.

## Our Mission

At Parametriks, we aim to:

- **Reduce insurance payouts**: By analyzing and predicting risk factors using IoT devices, we empower clients to take proactive measures to reduce their risks.
- **Optimize premium pricing**: By understanding the actions clients take to mitigate risks, insurers can adjust and price insurance premiums more accurately, ultimately lowering them.

## What We Do

Parametriks integrates with various IoT devices, such as CCTV systems and environmental sensors, to gather data that provides insights into the risk profiles of buildings and other insured assets. Our solutions include:

- **CCTV Integration**: Monitoring and analyzing video data to detect potential hazards and identify risk patterns.
- **Sensor Data Analysis**: Using sensors to monitor environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion) and provide real-time alerts to mitigate risks like fire, flooding, or unauthorized access.

By managing risk dynamically and offering data-driven insights, we help insurers and their clients create safer environments, leading to fewer claims and more optimized insurance products.
