# Machine Learning-Assisted Data Transformation for Insurance Platform

This document outlines the machine learning process that transforms client-provided insurance data into a structured format aligned with our **Database Relational Diagram**. Leveraging **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and advanced machine learning algorithms, the platform standardizes and enriches raw data from varied sources for seamless integration.

## Overview

### Client Data

Clients or insurers may provide insurance data in various formats, primarily in CSV files and associated text documents that describe the CSV structure. These files often lack a standard format, necessitating a flexible, automated process for understanding and transforming data.

### Transformation Objectives

1. **Data Understanding**: Interpret client data structures, labels, and descriptions using LLMs.
2. **Algorithm Selection**: Use LLMs trained on insurance, mathematics, and statistics knowledge to suggest the best machine learning algorithms for data transformation.
3. **Data Standardization**: Transform data into a unified format according to the **Database Relational Diagram** schema.
4. **Integration**: Store transformed data into the platform's database, ready for insights and predictive analytics.

## Transformation Process

### Step 1: **Data Ingestion**

- **Format Compatibility**: Accept data in multiple formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) and include metadata from descriptive text files.
- **Initial Storage**: Store the raw data in a secure and accessible environment on the platform.

### Step 2: **Data Interpretation Using LLM**

- **Schema Analysis**: The LLM, using natural language processing, interprets the data schema, column headers, and any descriptive information.
- **Entity Mapping**: Matches fields from client data to relevant entities in the Database Relational Diagram (e.g., `FACILITIES`, `SENSORS`, `RISKS`).

### Step 3: **Algorithm Selection**

- The LLM leverages its training in statistical and machine learning methodologies to recommend algorithms tailored for the transformation task, including:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Identifies and corrects inconsistencies (e.g., missing values, outliers).
  - **Normalization and Standardization**: Aligns numerical and categorical data to the platform’s schema.
  - **Text Classification**: Classifies unstructured text fields into predefined categories (e.g., `risk_type` in `RISKS`).
  - **Anomaly Detection**: Suggests models to identify anomalies, which can be mapped to `ANOMALIES` in the database.

### Step 4: **Data Transformation**

- **Mapping and Standardization**: Applies transformations based on the selected algorithms to convert raw data into a standard format.
- **Entity Relationships**: Establishes relationships across entities (e.g., linking `SENSORS` to `FACILITIES`) as outlined in the Database Relational Diagram.

### Step 5: **Database Insertion**

- The transformed data is now in a schema-compliant format, ready to be inserted into the database.
- **Error Handling**: Any inconsistencies during insertion are logged for review.

### Step 6: **Continuous Learning**

- Feedback from data analysts is used to fine-tune the machine learning algorithms, enhancing future transformations for accuracy and efficiency.

## Benefits of Machine Learning Integration

- **Automated Data Understanding**: The LLM’s ability to interpret schema and descriptions simplifies onboarding for new clients.
- **Intelligent Transformation**: Algorithm recommendations by LLMs ensure data is efficiently transformed and standardized.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Machine learning reduces manual errors and ensures data integrity.
- **Scalability**: The platform can easily scale to handle data from multiple clients with varied formats.

Machine learning enables efficient, accurate, and scalable data integration, providing clients with immediate access to analytics and insights on the platform.
