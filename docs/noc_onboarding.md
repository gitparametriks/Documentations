2. **Software Installation**: Install any necessary tools on your development environment (e.g., PostgreSQL, Python libraries, Git).
3. **Environment Setup**: Clone the relevant repositories from GitHub and follow the instructions in the README files to set up your local environment.

## 4. Overview of the Platform

### Platform Structure

Our platform is structured around a database-driven architecture, which integrates data from various sources and provides analytics and insights through a dashboard interface.

### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects and integrates data from multiple sources.
2. **Backend Services**: Processes, stores, and manages data, including API endpoints for data retrieval.
3. **Database Schema**: The central data structure of our platform. It is essential to understand the schema to know where data is stored and how it‚Äôs related.
4. **Frontend**: A user-facing dashboard built with modern JavaScript frameworks to visualize data and provide insights.

## 5. Project-Specific Documentation

### Database Schema Overview

Refer to the [Database Schema Documentation](/database_schema.md) for detailed information on the database structure, including entity descriptions, relationships, and the data flow across platform components.

### Component Summary

Check the component summary table in the documentation for an overview of platform components, required data, and retrieval methods.

### Data Sources

We work with various data sources, which can range from sensors and facility management systems to financial and environmental data. The platform‚Äôs flexibility allows for future integrations with external datasets. You‚Äôll be involved in understanding these sources, potentially adding new ones, and working on optimizing data ingestion.

## 6. Best Practices and Development Workflow

### Development Workflow

- **Start with Issue Tracking**: Begin by checking Github for any assigned issues or tasks. Each task is prioritized and detailed with expected outcomes.
- **Branching and Pull Requests**: Follow the branching strategy outlined in our GitHub repository guidelines. Make sure to create a new branch for each task and submit a pull request (PR) for review.
- **Code Reviews**: All code goes through peer review. This is an opportunity for you to receive feedback and improve code quality.
- **Testing**: Ensure all code changes are thoroughly tested. Unit tests are essential for backend changes, while data integration tests ensure data consistency.

### Coding Best Practices

- **Documentation**: Document all code thoroughly. Any significant logic or approach should be explained in comments.
- **Modularity**: Write modular and reusable code. Avoid hard-coded values and aim for parameterization where possible.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data integrity by validating inputs and outputs, especially when integrating new data sources.

## 7. Performance and Improvement Goals

Throughout your internship, we encourage you to:

- **Ask Questions**: Clarify any uncertainties with your manager or team members. Your learning is a priority, and the team is here to support you.
- **Set Personal Goals**: Work with your mentor to set achievable goals that align with your interests and the company's objectives.
- **Provide Feedback**: Share your thoughts on improving processes, workflows, or areas of the platform. Your fresh perspective is valuable.

## 8. Contacts and Resources
