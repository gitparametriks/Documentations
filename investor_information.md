## Why Invest in PARAMETRIKS?

PARAMETRIKS is at the forefront of transforming the insurance industry, providing a platform that addresses the pressing need for proactive risk management and reduction in claims. Our solutions enable insurers to offer tailored, data-driven policies, adapting premium pricing based on clients' actions and risk profiles. The demand for predictive analytics and IoT-based insights in insurance is growing as climate events and operational risks increase, positioning PARAMETRIKS to capture significant market share.

## Market Opportunity

The insurance industry, particularly Property & Casualty (P&C), faces increasing challenges with risk assessment as climate change accelerates natural disasters and unpredictable events. As of 2023:

- **Global P&C Market Growth**: With the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for P&C insurance projected at 6.5%, the market is expected to reach $2.6 trillion by 2028.
- **Premium Pricing Pressures**: Inflation, catastrophe events, and claims volatility are driving premium increases; insurers seek innovative solutions to mitigate these costs and attract clients.

PARAMETRIKS leverages IoT and machine learning to help insurers manage these pressures, decrease payouts, and improve client retention.

## Financial Performance and Revenue Streams

PARAMETRIKS generates revenue through a mix of subscription fees, performance-based incentives, and direct contracts with insurance partners. Our scalable SaaS model enables us to cater to diverse clients across geographies, contributing to consistent and growing revenue streams.

### Revenue Streams

1. **Subscription Fees**: A monthly fee per property, averaging **$300 per building**, for clients integrating PARAMETRIKS' predictive platform.
2. **Contract-Based Revenue**: We take a **7-12% share** of premiums for policies offered through our insurance partners. This incentivizes long-term alignment and commitment to policy efficacy.
3. **Performance-Based Incentives**: For clients seeing a demonstrable reduction in claims or enhanced operational safety, PARAMETRIKS takes a cut of the first-year insurance premium reduction.
4. **Equipment Leasing**: Monthly fees for IoT kits ($30/month per kit) allow clients to access real-time monitoring tools with minimal upfront investment.

Our financial model is structured to ensure predictable, recurring revenue with opportunities for upselling as clients expand IoT coverage across their assets.
