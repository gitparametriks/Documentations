# About Me

Hello! I'm **Javian Ng**, a passionate machine learning engineer and software engineer previously working (if you see this and you are the next intern, i am likely gone already) at **Parametriks**, a startup focused on leveraging IoT technology and predictive algorithms to revolutionize the insurance industry.

This Documentation page was crafted by me, and is a project that started on 25 October 2024. It should be relatively easy to follow along and guide you along on what you need to do as an intern here.

> Take note that my position then was a software engineer and machine learning engineer and so some of the details might not be relevant to you if you are not taking on the same role.
